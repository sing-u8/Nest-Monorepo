# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Auth service는 NestJS와 Nx 모노레포 환경에서 클린 아키텍처 원칙을 적용하여 구현되는 인증 및 사용자 관리 서비스입니다. 이 서비스는 다양한 인증 방식(JWT, mTLS, 소셜 로그인)을 지원하며, 확장 가능하고 유지보수가 용이한 구조로 설계됩니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: 사용자 관리

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register and manage my account, so that I can access the system with my credentials

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid registration data (email, password, name) THEN the system SHALL create a new user account
2. WHEN a user provides an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL return an error message
3. WHEN a user provides invalid email format THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
4. WHEN a user provides a password shorter than 8 characters THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
5. WHEN a user updates their profile information THEN the system SHALL validate and save the changes
6. WHEN a user uploads a profile picture THEN the system SHALL validate file type and size before saving

### Requirement 2: JWT 기반 일반 로그인

**User Story:** As a user, I want to login with my email and password using JWT tokens, so that I can securely access the system

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid email and password THEN the system SHALL return access and refresh JWT tokens
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
3. WHEN a user's account is locked or disabled THEN the system SHALL deny access
4. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL require token refresh or re-authentication
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the current tokens
6. WHEN a refresh token is used THEN the system SHALL generate new access and refresh tokens

### Requirement 3: mTLS 기반 일반 로그인

**User Story:** As a user with client certificates, I want to authenticate using mTLS, so that I can access the system with certificate-based security

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presents a valid client certificate THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user
2. WHEN a client certificate is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL deny access
3. WHEN a client certificate is not trusted by the CA THEN the system SHALL reject the connection
4. WHEN mTLS authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL return appropriate tokens or session
5. WHEN certificate revocation is detected THEN the system SHALL deny access

### Requirement 4: Google 소셜 로그인

**User Story:** As a user, I want to login using my Google account, so that I can access the system without creating a separate password

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates Google OAuth flow THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google authorization server
2. WHEN Google returns valid authorization code THEN the system SHALL exchange it for user information
3. WHEN a Google user logs in for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a new user account
4. WHEN a Google user already exists THEN the system SHALL authenticate the existing user
5. WHEN Google OAuth fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error message
6. WHEN Google user data is received THEN the system SHALL map it to internal user structure

### Requirement 5: Apple 소셜 로그인

**User Story:** As a user, I want to login using my Apple ID, so that I can access the system with Apple's privacy-focused authentication

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates Apple Sign In flow THEN the system SHALL redirect to Apple authorization server
2. WHEN Apple returns valid identity token THEN the system SHALL verify and extract user information
3. WHEN an Apple user logs in for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a new user account
4. WHEN an Apple user already exists THEN the system SHALL authenticate the existing user
5. WHEN Apple Sign In fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error message
6. WHEN Apple provides limited user data THEN the system SHALL handle privacy settings appropriately

### Requirement 6: 토큰 관리 및 보안

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure token management, so that user sessions are properly protected

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokens are generated THEN the system SHALL use secure random generation and proper signing
2. WHEN tokens contain sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt the payload
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL enforce expiration policies
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL revoke relevant tokens
5. WHEN token validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify signature and expiration
6. WHEN refresh tokens are used THEN the system SHALL implement rotation for enhanced security

### Requirement 7: 데이터 보안 및 검증

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my data to be properly protected, so that my personal information remains secure

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL hash them using bcrypt or similar secure algorithm
2. WHEN sensitive data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption
3. WHEN user input is received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs
4. WHEN authentication attempts fail repeatedly THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting
5. WHEN user data is accessed THEN the system SHALL log security events for auditing
6. WHEN personal data is processed THEN the system SHALL comply with privacy regulations

### Requirement 8: 모노레포 및 아키텍처 구조

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured codebase following clean architecture, so that the system is maintainable and scalable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is organized THEN the system SHALL follow Nx monorepo structure with clear app/lib separation
2. WHEN code is structured THEN the system SHALL implement clean architecture layers (entities, use cases, adapters, frameworks)
3. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL follow dependency inversion principle
4. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN the system SHALL be independent of frameworks and external concerns
5. WHEN tests are written THEN the system SHALL allow testing of business logic without external dependencies
6. WHEN modules are created THEN the system SHALL have clear boundaries and interfaces between layers
